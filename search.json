    "text": "1. Create a Database\nUsing the instructions from the homework, I first created a database with three tables: temperatures, stations, and countries.\nTo create a database from the NOAA climate data, I used sqlite3 to create the database and to query the data, as well as pandas to manipulate the dataframes.\n# importing the libraries  \nimport sqlite3 \nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np \n\n# Importing the csv file \ntemps_df = pd.read_csv(\"temps.csv\")\ntemps_df.head()\nNext, the temperature database had to be cleaned. The prepare_df reorganizes the tempperature data so that it can be easily used.\ndef prepare_df(df):\n    df = df.set_index(keys=[\"ID\", \"Year\"])\n    df = df.stack()\n    df = df.reset_index()\n    df = df.rename(columns = {\"level_2\"  : \"Month\" , 0 : \"Temp\"})\n    df[\"Month\"] = df[\"Month\"].str[5:].astype(int)\n    df[\"Temp\"]  = df[\"Temp\"] / 100\n    return(df)\nNow, we are going to start creating the connection into the climate database. As per the homework, our database will be called climate-database.db.\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"climate-database.db\") # temperature database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe realize that the temerature data set contains many rows, so it is better to have the data be loaded into the database in chunks. The following loop iterates through the 100000 rows of the data at a time, cleaning it with prepare_df and adding it to the database.\n\n\ntemps_iter = pd.read_csv(\"temps.csv\", chunksize = 100000)\n\nfor i, temps_df in enumerate(temps_iter): \n    df = prepare_df(temps_df)\n    df.to_sql(\"temperatures\", conn, if_exists=\"replace\" if i == 0 else \"append\", index = False)\nSince the temerature table is ready, we will start to read in the data from the station and country and add them as individual tables into the database.\n# Adding the stations table\nstations = pd.read_csv(\"station-metadata.csv\") \nstations.to_sql(\"stations\", conn, if_exists = \"replace\", index = False)\n\n# Adding the countries table\ncountries = pd.read_csv(\"countries.csv\")\ncountries.to_sql(\"countries\", conn, if_exists = \"replace\", index = False)\nTo make sure that the tables are created, we will use a cursor to look into the SQL table.\ncursor = conn.cursor() \n\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';\")\n\nfor result in cursor.fetchall():\n    print(result[0])\nYou should get something like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nOnce you have this, you have successfully created a climate database."

    "text": "2. Writing a Query\nIn order for us to access the climate-database, we need to write a SQL query. I used the following query to access key information that the homework is asking us to retrieve:\nimport sqlite3\nimport pandas as pd \n\ndef query_climate_database(db_file, country, year_begin, year_end, month): \n    \n    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)\n\n    query = f'''\n                SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp\n                FROM temperatures T \n                LEFT JOIN stations S on T.id = S.id\n                LEFT JOIN countries C on SUBSTRING(T.id, 1, 2) = C.'FIPS 10-4'\n                WHERE T.year &gt;= {year_begin} AND T.year &lt;= {year_end} AND T.month == {month} AND C.name == \"{country}\"\n                '''\n\n    df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)\n\n    conn.close()\n    return df \nTo keep it short, here is a quick run down about what this query is doing:\nSELECT - Selecting the name, latitude, and longitude from STATIONS; Name from COUNTRIES; Year, Month, and Temp from TEMPERATURES\nFROM - Temperatures table (Aliased as T for readability purposes)  \nLEFT JOIN - IDs from Temperature that equal to the FIPS 10-4 values are to be selected\nLEFT JOIN - Values from Stations that match IDs with values in the Temperatures table\nWHERE - The year is greater than or equal to year_begin and less than or equal to the year_end and where Month equals month and Country equals country.  \nAfter this, you must import the .py file into the index.ipynb file, and you can start making the queries. This is a sample query provided in the homework.\nindia_df = query_climate_database(db_file = \"climate_database.db\",\n                       country = \"India\", \n                       year_begin = 1980, \n                       year_end = 2020,\n                       month = 1)"

Using the function call from earlier, we get data from both the Philippines and Indonesia.  \nWe will use the groupby and max() function in order to find both the max and min values per country as follows:\nprint(\"Maximum Temp per Year\")\nmax_data = df.groupby(['Name', 'NAME', 'Year'])['Temp'].max()\nprint(max_data)\n\nprint()\nprint(\"Minimum Temp per Year\")\nmin_data = df.groupby(['Name', 'NAME', 'Year'])['Temp'].min()\nprint(min_data)\n\n# turning them into dataframes \nmin_data_df = min_data.to_frame() \ndisplay(min_data_df)\n\nmax_data_df = max_data.to_frame() \ndisplay(max_data_df)\nThis organizes the data into two seperate dataframes: min_data_df and max_data_df. We will use this in order to calculate the means next.\nprint(\"Min temp mean\")\n# min data \nmin_mean = min_data_df.groupby(['Year', 'Name'])['Temp'].mean()\nprint(min_mean)\n\nprint()\nprint(\"Max temp mean\")\n# max data \nmax_mean = max_data_df.groupby(['Year', 'Name'])['Temp'].mean()\nprint(max_mean)\nNow that this is done, we must convert the datasets into dataframes. Currently, they are series data, therefore we must use the to_frame() and reset_index() in order to do this.\n# converting series to frame \nmin_df = min_mean.to_frame()\nmax_df = max_mean.to_frame()\n\nmin_df = min_df.reset_index()\nmin_df\n\nmax_df = max_df.reset_index() \nmax_df\nNow we can start putting it on a plot! We will create two seperate plots displaying the minimum and maximum temperatures of the countries.\nfig1 = px.line(min_df, x=\"Year\", y=\"Min_Temp\", color=\"Name\", title=\"Comparing the Min Temperatures of the Philippines and Indonesia\")\nfig2 = px.line(max_df, x = \"Year\", y = \"Temp\", color=\"Name\", title=\"Comparing the Max Temperatures of the Philippines and Indonesia\")\n\nfig1.show()\nfig2.show()\n\n\n\nVisualization 2: Comparing the Average Temperatures of Two Different Airports in the Philippines\nSimilar to the first visualization, we first call on the SQL query function for this data.\ndf = second_climate_database(db_file = \"climate_database.db\", \n                           country1 = \"Philippines\", \n                           country2 = \"United States\",\n                           year_begin = 2000, \n                           year_end = 2010)\ndf\nNow, since we are only looking at the Philippines, then we must drop the United States data from the dataframe.\n# filtering the united states data out since we only want to focus on the philippines\ndf_filtered = df[df['Name'] != 'United States']\ndf_filtered\nLet’s look at the unique values in the NAME column to find the airports.\n# now looking at the unique values \nunique_values = df['NAME'].unique()\nunique_values\n\nWe are now going to assign specific airports and start filtering the dataframe so that we only get the values associated with those two airports.\nspecific_airports = ['MANILA_INT_AIRPORT', 'MACTAN_CEBU_INTL'] \n\ndf_filtered = df_filtered[df_filtered['NAME'].isin(specific_airports)]\nprint(df_filtered)\nIn order to compare both, I figured a box plot was most appropriate since this displays the average temperatures for the two airports between 2000 and 2008. Here is what the visualization looks like after running the code:\nfig = px.box(df_filtered, x='Year', y='Temp', color='NAME')\nfig.show()"

However, after spending time on them, I slowly started to understand and get the hang of writing them. I thought that it was very helpful to just think about it in a logical way and verbalize them (i.e. I am going to SELECT country names and temperatures FROM the temperature tables WHERE the country names match x.)\n\nI also learned how important data cleaning was! There were many times where my data visualizations did not look correct because I did not clean and organize the dataframes.\n\nThank you for reading on how to create data visualizations!"

    "text": "Before starting, I had to import the following libraries in order to complete this assignment:\n\nfrom flask import Flask, g, render_template, request\nimport sqlite3\n\nNext, create and launch the Flask app using this.\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\nHere is the GitHub Repository for this: GitHub  \nNow you are ready to start building your website!\n\n\nAs per the instructions, we are asked to create a submit template with three user inteface elements:\n\nA text box for submitting a message.\nA textbox for submitting the name of the user.\nA “submit” button.\n\nI wrote the following code in the submit.html file first and I will explain as follows:\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n\n{% block header %}\n&lt;h1&gt;{% block title %}Submit a Message{% endblock %}&lt;/h1&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;form method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;label for=\"message\"&gt;Your message:&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" id=\"message\"&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;label for=\"name\"&gt;Your name or handle:&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\"&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit message\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n{% if (name) and (message) %}\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Hello {{name}}, Thank you for submitting your message! &lt;/b&gt;\n{% else %}\n&lt;b&gt; Please submit all entries &lt;/b&gt;\n{% endif %}\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\n{% extends 'base.html' %} - This allows for an extension from the ‘base.html’ file and replaces the templates with the content on this page but still maintaining the navigation bar on top.\n&lt;form method=\"post\"&gt; Section - This block of content contains the necessary code in order to meet the submission requirements.\n\nThe message allows for a text input from the user which creates a box. This is the same idea for the getting the name.\n‘Submit message’ - This is the submission button.\n\nThe rest of the code simply outputs a message that thanks the user {name} for their input.\n\nBefore adding this to the app.py, we must build a SQL database and insertion function to store the messages.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this function allows for the creation of the message database.   In order to build this, we must first check if the message table exists within the message_db.sqlite. We check this by writing a SQL query as so:\n    cursor.execute(\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (handle TEXT, message TEXT);\")\nWe check if there is a database called message_db in the g attribute of the app. Then once there is confirmation, then we do not need to connect one. If there is, then that is when we are going to connect a new database.\nI wrote the following code to demonstrate this (which also includes the query):\ndef get_message_db():\n    # purpose: to handle a database full of messages \n    if 'db' not in g: \n       g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('message_db.sqlite')\n\n    conn = g.message_db\n    cursor = conn.cursor()\n\n    # creating the table if it does not exist \n    cursor.execute(\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (handle TEXT, message TEXT);\")\n\n    return g.message_db\nNow you are done writing the get_message_db() function.\n\n\n\nThis function handles inserting a user message into the database.\nRecall that we specified the message and handle objects in the submit.html file. We are going to retrieve those with the request function. We are going to access them with the request.form[\"message/name\"] method.\nThis is how I built this function:\ndef insert_message(request):\n  # extracting the message and handle from the request \n  message = request.form[\"message\"]\n  handle = request.form[\"name\"]\n\n  db = get_message_db() \n  error = None # keeping track of empty messages \n\n  if error is None: \n     db.execute(\"INSERT INTO messages (handle, message) VALUES (?,?)\", (handle, message)) # query to add the messages to the db \n     db.commit() \n\n  db.close() \n\n  return message, handle\nFinally, we are ready to build the submit app route.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to interact with the submit function on the app.py.\nIn the app.py, this houses all the url routes to different pages in your website.   I wrote the following code in order to do this.\n@app.route('/send-message/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])\ndef send_message(): \n   if request.method == 'GET': \n    return render_template('submit.html')\n   \n   else:\n      try: \n        insert_message(request) # running insert message \n        return render_template('submit.html', name=request.form['name'], message=request.form['message']) # returns submit html with the successful submission\n      except: \n         return render_template('submit.html') \n\n\n\n@app.route('/send-messge/') - This produces the URL extension so that we can access the submission page.\nsend_message() - This function handles the SQL database that stores the messages.\ninsert_message(request) - This calls the function that inserts the message into the SQL database.\nrender_template('submit.html') - This calls the template to be shown on the screen when this URL/page is being accesssed. Here, it will show what we wrote for the submissions category.\n\nIf you run the website, this is what it looks like!\n\n\n\nCompleted submission area\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are tasked to build a way to view the messages on the navigation.\nBefore we start, we first make View a Random Message an option on the navigation bar.\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ url_for('view') }}\"&gt;View a Random Message&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n\n\nNavigation Bar\n\n\nThen, we are going to make a function random_messages(n) that helps show the submissions (name and handle) to the user.\n\nThis communicates with the get_message_db function, meaning that it communicates with the SQL database that we created earlier.\n\ndef random_messages(n): \n   \"\"\"\n   Returns random messages\n   \"\"\"\n\n   db = get_message_db() \n   cursor = db.cursor() \n  \n   cursor.execute(\"SELECT message, handle FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT (?)\", (n,))\n   messages = cursor.fetchall()\n\n   db.close() \n\n   return messages \n\n\n\nSQL query cursor.execute(\"SELECT message, handle FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT (?)\", (n,)) - This selects the message and handle value from the table messages in a random order and only takes 5 of them at a single time.\n\nNow, we are going to create a view.html file that creates another page to view the messages.\nSimilar to the submit.html file, this will create extend the base.html we made so that the navigation bar still exists.\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n\n{% block header %}\n&lt;h1&gt;{% block title %}View some epic messages!{% endblock %}&lt;/h1&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n  {% for content in message_list %}\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;b&gt;{{content.0}}&lt;/b&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;i&gt;{{content.1}}&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\n\nThe {% for content in message_list %} loop will go through the messages, then select and display them randomly on the screen.\n\nAfter we created this, we will go back to the app.py so that we can build a URL route to access this page.\n@app.route('/view/')\ndef view(): \n  limit = 5\n  mylist=random_messages(limit) # runs the random amt of messages\n  return render_template('view.html', message_list = mylist)\n\n\n\n\nlimit = 5 - This limits the amount of messages that the function will output to 5.\nSimilar process to the previous routes, it will call the function and render the template that we created.\n\nAfter that is complete, this is what your website should look like:\n\n\n\nView Messages\n\n\nAnd that’s it for the tutorial! Congratulations, you have a complete website!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the things that was most challenging was understanding how the app.routes and the templates connected to one another. I kept running into Internal server errors all the time when trying to connect them. After reading a few tutorials, I managed to do them.\nWeb dev is fun! I really like playing around with the design and learning the back end work was super neat! :D"

If there is, then that is when we are going to connect a new database.\nI wrote the following code to demonstrate this (which also includes the query):\ndef get_message_db():\n    # purpose: to handle a database full of messages \n    if 'db' not in g: \n       g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('message_db.sqlite')\n\n    conn = g.message_db\n    cursor = conn.cursor()\n\n    # creating the table if it does not exist \n    cursor.execute(\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (handle TEXT, message TEXT);\")\n\n    return g.message_db\nNow you are done writing the get_message_db() function.\n\n\n\nThis function handles inserting a user message into the database.\nRecall that we specified the message and handle objects in the submit.html file. We are going to retrieve those with the request function. We are going to access them with the request.form[\"message/name\"] method.\nThis is how I built this function:\ndef insert_message(request):\n  # extracting the message and handle from the request \n  message = request.form[\"message\"]\n  handle = request.form[\"name\"]\n\n  db = get_message_db() \n  error = None # keeping track of empty messages \n\n  if error is None: \n     db.execute(\"INSERT INTO messages (handle, message) VALUES (?,?)\", (handle, message)) # query to add the messages to the db \n     db.commit() \n\n  db.close() \n\n  return message, handle\nFinally, we are ready to build the submit app route."

Congratulations, you have a complete website!"
