## üì® Task: Write a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set. 

**üõë BEFORE STARTING üõë** Make sure to import these libraries used: Plotly, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn 

#### üêß **Step 1:** Import palmer_penguins CSV to the environment. 

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pic16b-ucla/24W/main/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
#### üêß **Step 2:** Perform some data cleaning steps.

```python
penguins.info()

# cleaning the data
penguins.isnull().sum()

# filling nan values with 0
penguins.fillna(0)
```

##### **Some methods I used:**

.info() 
: Presents the information of each column and the amount of entries within each column.  

.isnull().sum() 
: Takes the sum of each column that has a NaN value.  

#### üêß **Step 3:** Use Plotly to create nicer looking graphs. 
*"Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts."* -- From [Plotly Website](https://plotly.com/python/)

‚òÉÔ∏è I decided to use plotly because of its ability to create complex but informational graphs, charts, plots easily. I utilized the scatterplot code from their [documentation](https://plotly.com/python/figure-labels/) to create the plot. 

```python 
from plotly import express as px

# create a scatter plot
fig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins, x = 'Body Mass (g)', y = 'Flipper Length (mm)', color = "Species",
                 width = 1000, height = 600, title = "Flipper Length (mm) and Body Mass (g) for Penguin Species")

fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0, "t":50, "l":0, "b":0})

#show the plot
fig.show()
```

‚òÉÔ∏è I chose to represent the flipper length (mm) and body mass (g) for all penguin species that were present in the data set. 

#### **Results:**
As a result, I got this table!

#### **Takeaways:** 
‚≠êÔ∏è It was a good introduction to writing Quarto blogs. It took me a while to understand, but I managed to do it so I think that is what mattered the most. :> 

‚≠êÔ∏è I want to work towards learning to read and search through documentation. In order to create the plots, I had to outsource to the Plotly documentation website, which required some reading and attention.
