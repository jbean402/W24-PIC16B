    "## Task: Create interesting and interactive data visualizations using the NOAA Climate Database. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create a Database\n",
    "Using the instructions from the homework, I first created a database with three tables: temperatures, stations, and countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a database from the NOAA climate data, I used sqlite3 to create the database and to query the data, as well as pandas to manipulate the dataframes. \n",
    " \n",
    " ```python \n",
    "# importing the libraries  \n",
    "import sqlite3 \n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np \n",
    "\n",
    "# Importing the csv file \n",
    "temps_df = pd.read_csv(\"temps.csv\")\n",
    "temps_df.head()\n",
    "\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "Next, the temperature database had to be cleaned. The prepare_df reorganizes the tempperature data so that it can be easily used. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def prepare_df(df):\n",
    "    df = df.set_index(keys=[\"ID\", \"Year\"])\n",
    "    df = df.stack()\n",
    "    df = df.reset_index()\n",
    "    df = df.rename(columns = {\"level_2\"  : \"Month\" , 0 : \"Temp\"})\n",
    "    df[\"Month\"] = df[\"Month\"].str[5:].astype(int)\n",
    "    df[\"Temp\"]  = df[\"Temp\"] / 100\n",
    "    return(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are going to start creating the connection into the climate database. As per the homework, our database will be called *climate-database.db*. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect(\"climate-database.db\") # temperature database\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note} \n",
    "We realize that the temerature data set contains many rows, so it is better to have the data be loaded into the database in chunks. The following loop iterates through the 100000 rows of the data at a time, cleaning it with `prepare_df` and adding it to the database. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temps_iter = pd.read_csv(\"temps.csv\", chunksize = 100000)\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, temps_df in enumerate(temps_iter): \n",
    "    df = prepare_df(temps_df)\n",
    "    df.to_sql(\"temperatures\", conn, if_exists=\"replace\" if i == 0 else \"append\", index = False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the temerature table is ready, we will start to read in the data from the station and country and add them as individual tables into the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Adding the stations table\n",
    "stations = pd.read_csv(\"station-metadata.csv\") \n",
    "stations.to_sql(\"stations\", conn, if_exists = \"replace\", index = False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding the countries table\n",
    "countries = pd.read_csv(\"countries.csv\")\n",
    "countries.to_sql(\"countries\", conn, if_exists = \"replace\", index = False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that the tables are created, we will use a cursor to look into the SQL table. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor() \n",
    "\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for result in cursor.fetchall():\n",
    "    print(result[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should get something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Output](Output.png){width=250}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have this, you have successfully created a climate database. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Writing a Query \n",
    "In order for us to access the `climate-database`, we need to write a SQL query. I used the following query to access key information that the homework is asking us to retrieve: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "import pandas as pd \n",
    "\n",
    "def query_climate_database(db_file, country, year_begin, year_end, month): \n",
    "    \n",
    "    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "    query = f'''\n",
    "                SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp\n",
    "                FROM temperatures T \n",
    "                LEFT JOIN stations S on T.id = S.id\n",
    "                LEFT JOIN countries C on SUBSTRING(T.id, 1, 2) = C.'FIPS 10-4'\n",
    "                WHERE T.year >= {year_begin} AND T.year <= {year_end} AND T.month == {month} AND C.name == \"{country}\"\n",
    "                '''\n",
    "\n",
    "    df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)\n",
    "\n",
    "    conn.close()\n",
    "    return df \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it short, here is a quick run down about what this query is doing: \\\n",
    "`SELECT` - Selecting the name, latitude, and longitude from STATIONS; Name from COUNTRIES; Year, Month, and Temp from TEMPERATURES \\\n",
    "`FROM` - Temperatures table (Aliased as T for readability purposes) \\ \\\n",
    "`LEFT JOIN` - IDs from Temperature that equal to the `FIPS 10-4` values are to be selected \\\n",
    "`LEFT JOIN` - Values from Stations that match IDs with values in the Temperatures table \\\n",
    "`WHERE` - The year is greater than or equal to year_begin and less than or equal to the year_end and where Month equals month and Country equals country. \\ \n",
    "\n",
    "After this, you must import the `.py` file into the `index.ipynb` file, and you can start making the queries. This is a sample query provided in the homework. \n"
